# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?

`describe()` creates a block that groups together several related tests in one "test suite". `it()` is mainly used for individual tests that are grouped in the `describe()` block.

2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?

TDD is having you write your test first and then writing your code based off of your test. I think it is a good approach in some acspects. I would just like to know what I would be testing first before I start writing my test.

3.  What are `mocks`? What are a good use cases for them?

Objects that simulate the behavior of real objects.

4.  Mention three types of automated tests.

`Automated Testing`

`Automated Web Servicce / API Tests`

`Automated GUI Tests`
